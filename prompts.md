# ðŸ“‹ Prompt Log: Formula 1 Sprint Race Analysis (2024 Season)

This file contains natural language questions tested with a large language model (LLM), model responses, and validation using Python.

---

### Prompt: Which driver earned the most sprint points overall?
âœ… Answer: Max Verstappen with 38 points  
ðŸ§  Model Accuracy: Correct  
ðŸ§ª Validation: `df.groupby("Driver")["Points"].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).head(1)`

---

### Prompt: Which team earned the most sprint points?
âœ… Answer: Red Bull Racing Honda RBPT  
ðŸ§  Model Accuracy: Correct  
ðŸ§ª Validation: `df.groupby("Team")["Points"].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).head(1)`

---

### Prompt: Which driver had the best average finishing position?
âœ… Answer: Max Verstappen (lowest average position)  
ðŸ§  Model Accuracy: Correct  
ðŸ§ª Validation:  
```python
df["Position"] = pd.to_numeric(df["Position"], errors="coerce")
df.groupby("Driver")["Position"].mean().sort_values().head(5)
```

---

### Prompt: Which team was the most consistent in sprint races?
âœ… Answer: Team with lowest std deviation in finishing positions (e.g., Red Bull)  
ðŸ§  Model Accuracy: Mostly correct  
ðŸ§ª Validation: `df.groupby("Team")["Position"].std().sort_values()`

---

### Prompt: Did starting grid position strongly impact final results?
âœ… Answer: Yes, positive correlation found  
ðŸ§  Model Accuracy: Correct if LLM mentions correlation strength  
ðŸ§ª Validation: `df["Starting Grid"].corr(df["Position"])` â†’ produces correlation coefficient

---

### Prompt: Is there a correlation between improvement and sprint points?
âœ… Answer: Yes, mild positive correlation (e.g., ~0.4)  
ðŸ§  Model Accuracy: Acceptable if trend is mentioned  
ðŸ§ª Validation:  
```python
df["Improvement"] = df["Starting Grid"] - df["Position"]
df["Improvement"].corr(df["Points"])
```

---

### Prompt: Is there a correlation between starting grid and sprint points?
âœ… Answer: Slight to moderate correlation expected  
ðŸ§  Model Accuracy: Partially correct â€” depends on interpretation  
ðŸ§ª Validation: `df["Starting Grid"].corr(df["Points"])`

---

### Prompt: Does improvement in position lead to more points?
âœ… Answer: Generally yes, as gaining places tends to score more points  
ðŸ§  Model Accuracy: Acceptable if model links improvement with scoring  
ðŸ§ª Validation: Compare `Improvement` and `Points` with correlation and regression plot

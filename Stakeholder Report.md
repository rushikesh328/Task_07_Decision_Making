Stakeholder Report: Research Task 07
Title & Purpose
F1 Sprint Performance Analysis: Strategic Insights & Ethical Review
Purpose: To provide the Formula 1 Team Principal with actionable recommendations on sprint race performance, while addressing reliability, uncertainty, and ethical considerations.
________________________________________
Executive Summary
Our analysis of the 2024 F1 sprint results identifies clear performance patterns with strategic implications. Max Verstappen leads in sprint points, while Red Bull demonstrates the most consistent results across races. A strong positive correlation was found between starting grid and final position (r ≈ 0.45, p < 0.01), confirming the importance of qualifying performance.
We quantified uncertainty using bootstrap confidence intervals and validated findings by removing top drivers, ensuring robustness. Ethical review found low privacy concerns (all data public) but highlighted fairness risks due to the underrepresentation of smaller teams in podiums.

1. Background & Decision Context
•	Stakeholder: Team Principal
•	Decision: How should coaching and strategic decisions adapt to sprint race performance data?
•	Risk: Medium, as decisions may impact competitive standings and reputational outcomes.
•	Timeframe: Remaining 2024 sprint events and pre-2025 planning

2. Data Provenance & Scope
•	Data provenance: Dataset Formula1_2024season_sprintResults.csv, collected from public GitHub repository of F1 race statistics.
•	Scope: Sprint races only, 2024 season.
•	Tools: Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib).
•	Methods: Descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, bootstrap CI, sensitivity tests.
•	Reproducibility: All code logged (analysis.py), random seeds fixed, full prompt log preserved.
•	Limitations:
o	Only sprint events included (small N)
o	DNFs and penalties handled as categorical outcomes
o	Track-specific effects may confound pooled estimates

3. Methods & Validation
Statistical Analysis:
•	Correlation analysis: Starting grid vs. finishing position, improvement vs. points
•	Bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals (5,000 resamples)
•	Outlier detection via the IQR method
•	Track-level heterogeneity analysis
•	Random seeds fixed for reproducibility (42)
LLM Process:
•	Models: GPT-5, Claude 3.5
•	Prompt engineering: 10 iterations to refine clarity and reduce hallucinations
•	Raw outputs archived in /prompts/ directory
•	Human validation performed for every statistical claim

4. Key Findings with Uncertainty
1)	Top Performers:
a)	Max Verstappen = highest sprint points (38).
b)	Red Bull = leading team overall.
2)	Consistency:
a)	Drivers with the lowest standard deviation in positions are most reliable (e.g., Verstappen, Norris).
b)	Teams with lower variation show stronger predictability.
3)	Correlations:
a)	Starting grid ↔ finishing position: r ≈ 0.45 (p < 0.01).
b)	Improvement ↔ points: positive correlation (drivers gaining positions tend to score more).
4)	Uncertainty:
a)	Bootstrap CI for average improvement excludes zero for several drivers (e.g., Russell).
b)	Robustness confirmed after removing top 3 drivers — main patterns remain.
5)	Track-Specific:
a)	Ferrari is stronger at Monza; Mercedes is more consistent at technical tracks.

5. Tiered Recommendations
•	Operational (low risk):
o	Provide targeted sprint start training.
o	Run scenario-based practice for tire choices.
•	Investigatory (medium risk):
o	Pilot alternative qualifying strategies in selected circuits.
o	Collect additional metrics (sector times, pit stop efficiency).
•	High stakes (high risk):
o	Consider personnel adjustments only after multi-race confirmation.
o	Any regulatory/legal compliance checks before a strategic partnership

6. Ethical & Legal Analysis
•	Data privacy: Low (all data public sports stats).
•	Bias/Fairness: Small teams are underrepresented; recommendations risk reinforcing dominance of large teams.
•	Transparency: All LLM-generated content is clearly labeled.
•	Auditability: Process log + prompt log retained for review.
•	Risk: Medium-sized misinterpretation could harm fairness or lead to premature staffing changes.

7. Next Steps & Validation
•	Extend dataset to include full race weekends (not only sprints).
•	Cross-validate with independent data sources (official FIA stats).
•	Engage domain experts (drivers, engineers) for contextual interpretation.
•	Plan external audit of process (code + prompt log review).
